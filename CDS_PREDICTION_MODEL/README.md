# CDS Predict Model ðŸ“ˆ

A project to build a baseline machine learning model to predict Korea CDS spread (5Y target planned), using publicly available macro and market data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goal

- Build a baseline machine learning model to **predict Korea CDS spread**.
- Since real-time CDS data is difficult to obtain, this project currently builds a **proxy dataset**.
- Goal: later benchmark with actual CDS data (Bloomberg, credit agency reports).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Why This Project?

- Korea CDS spread is a key indicator of **sovereign credit risk**.
- Financial markets already "price" this risk through various channels:
  - Bond Yield Curve (1Y vs. 10Y spread)
  - FX Market (USD/KRW exchange rate)
  - Stock Market (KOSPI Index)
  - Global risk sentiment (VIX)
  - Global macro sentiment (WTI crude oil price)

- Hypothesis: these variables can serve as **leading indicators** for CDS movements.
